Installation:

	pip install -e .

Application Instructions:

	Welcome to Mixcyclopedia! This application allows you to find the perfect cocktail recipe to make for any occasion. 

	Below are three ingredient panels which contain a wide variety of cocktail ingredients. The first panel lists all liquors with a high abv, such as vodka, gin, and tequila. 
	The second panel lists all ingredients which contain a lower alcohol percentage, such as liqueurs, wines, and beers. The third panel lists all non-alcoholic mixers such as 
	fruits, juices, and sodas. 

	Clicking on an ingredient from any of these panels will select the checkbox next to the ingredient’s name. All selected ingredients will then be used to find the perfect 
	cocktail recipe for you.

	On the bottom right, there are four buttons which allow you to add a new recipe, view possible recipes,view recipe ideas,and view all recipes. Clicking on the “show possible” 
	button will show you all recipes which you can make with the selected ingredients. All recipes which contain a non-selected ingredient will not be shown. Clicking the “show ideas” 
	button will show you all recipes which contain at least one of the selected ingredients. This will show recipes which contain non-selected ingredients, but is great when searching 
	for a new idea before going to the store, or finding all recipes with a specific ingredient. Clicking the “show all” button will show all recipes regardless of selected ingredients. 
	Finally, Clicking on the “add recipe” will direct you to a page where you can input a new recipe into the program. All newly added recipes will be saved for future uses of the program. 

	When on the viewing recipes page, all displayed recipes will have a “delete recipe” button which will delete the recipe from storage if there is a recipe you do not like, or if a newly 
	inputted recipe contains a mistake such as a spelling error.

	Happy Mixing!
